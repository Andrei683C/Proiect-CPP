Description

This project is a Patient Management System designed as part of the CMPE241 - Computer Programming II course. The program demonstrates Tabular Data Processing using objects, files, and dynamic arrays. It allows users to manage a database of patient records with features for adding, editing, searching, sorting, and saving patient data.
Features

The program includes the following functionalities:

    Load from File: Load patient data from a text file.
    New Entry: Add a new patient record.
    Find: Search for a specific patient record by various fields and perform operations like edit or delete.
    List Entries: Display all patient records in a tabular format.
    Sort Entries: Sort patient records based on a selected field.
    Save to File: Save the current data to a file for later use.
    Exit: Terminate the program.

Key Concepts

    Object-Oriented Programming:
        The Patient class encapsulates all patient-related data and provides getter and setter methods.
    Dynamic Memory Management:
        A dynamically allocated array is used to store patient records. The array resizes automatically as new entries are added.
    File Handling:
        Patient records are saved to and loaded from a file (save.txt).
